> **Problem Description**
>
> Current beekeeping methods are lacking in technological innovation.
> Because of climate change, parasites, pesticides, and starvation, 48
> percent of honeybee colonies in America were lost in the past year,
> the second highest death toll on record (Borenstein, 2023).
>
> Beekeepers are struggling to prevent a parasitic mite called Varroa
> from infesting these hives, and they don't have easy access to hive
> data in order to identify an early\
> infestation. With climate change, unnatural warm spots in the winter
> have brought bees out of hibernation early, which means beekeepers
> need to constantly track and manage hive temperature and humidity,
> usually with a manual probe. If bees leave hibernation early, they
> will starve to death from a lack of pollen from flowering plants. We
> rely on bees to provide for 80 percent of pollination for
> insect-pollinated plants, so a loss of pollination would devastate the
> agricultural industry (Randall, 2022). Beekeepers need easier and
>
> more efficient technology to address the losses beekeepers are facing
> in these trying times.
>
> **Scope**
>
> The scope for this product will be limited to UI development, as an
> automation and robotics company is working on the backend and robotics
> functionality. We are currently at the\
> prototyping phase with the Bee-Ring, so the UI should be focused on
> delivering basic app functionality and data for the frontend. This
> means storing and providing the data in an easy and accessible manner,
> and designing an intuitive UI interface. The goal is to manage
> real-time hive data in order to catch any health problems early on.
> This helps beekeepers keep their bees healthy, without dealing
> directly with a mountain of data. Additionally, there is a difference
> between hobby beekeeping and industrial beekeeping, with industrial
> beekeeping being at a much larger scale. With this in mind, this
> project is focusing exclusively on hobby beekeeping for now, but for
> future iterations, our project partner wants to include versions for
> industrial beekeeping and beekeeping research.
>
> **Use Cases**
>
> **Early Disease Detection**
>
> [Use Case]{.underline}: A beekeeper receives a notification on their
> smartphone when the monitoring system detects unusual temperature
> changes in a hive. This allows the beekeeper to investigate and
> address potential health issues, possibly preventing the spread of
> diseases within the colony.
>
> **Optimal Hive Environment**
>
> [Use Case]{.underline}: A beekeeper uses the system to maintain the
> right environmental conditions in the hives, especially during bad
> weather conditions. The monitoring system automatically adjusts
> temperature and humidity levels, ensuring the health of the colony.
> This stability leads to increased pollination rates and better honey
> production.
>
> **Remote Hive Monitoring and Management**
>
> [Use Case]{.underline}: Beekeepers, with hives in various locations,
> remotely monitor all their hives through a centralized dashboard. This
> enables prompt issue identification and potential resolution from a
> distance, ensuring the health of bee colonies without the need for
> frequent on-site visits.
>
> [Use Case]{.underline}: The user will check their beehive statistics
> through the app and see trends over a certain period of time such as
> changes in temperature or humidity.
>
> [Use Case]{.underline}: The user checks the health of their hive while
> they are at work. They see that the humidity of the hive is lower than
> optimal. They make an adjustment on the app to raise the humidity of
> the hive.
>
> **Efficient Hive Inspections**
>
> [Use Case]{.underline}: Beekeepers can remotely access hive data to
> make informed decisions about hive management. For example, they
> schedule inspections only when the system detects problems, reducing
> disruptions to the bees, saving time, and optimizing how resources are
> used.
>
> [Use Case]{.underline}: The user will be able to check on the queen
> bee status to see whether she is missing or present.
>
> [Use Case]{.underline}: The user will be able to see whether they need
> to refill the feeding trays.
>
> **Bee Ring Device Management**
>
> [Use Case]{.underline}: The user will access their settings on the app
> and select which specific notifications they want on beehive activity.
>
> [Use Case]{.underline}: The user will access their settings on the app
> and select the thresholds for certain notifications (i.e. temperature
> min and max, humidity min and max, etc).
>
> [Use Case]{.underline}: The user will add beehives with a Bee-Ring to
> the app so they can view the statuses for multiple bee hives via
> bluetooth connection.
>
> [Use Case]{.underline}: The user will set and track hive management
> goals through the Hive Management tab.
>
> **Purpose and Vision (Background)**
>
> Our purpose is to develop a beekeeping app that provides users with
> data on the health and productivity of their hives in real time so
> that users can improve beehive conditions and monitor changes over
> time.
>
> We want beekeepers to use our product for current and future hives; as
> more users interact with this product, more bees are saved.
>
> Currently, beekeepers are struggling with excessive hive losses every
> year, due to climate change, parasites, pesticides, and starvation.
> With the right data, some of these problems can be prevented with
> early detection of abnormalities in the hive. As it stands, beekeepers
> don't have easy access to preventative technologies.
>
> The Bee Ring wants to make beekeeping easy and effective, especially
> for small-scale beekeepers facing challenges due to declining bee
> populations. We want to simplify hive management by using smart
> technology. Our vision is to empower beekeepers with a user-friendly
> tool that manages hive data and prevents health issues early on. The
> Bee Ring is designed for beekeepers who are passionate about their
> hives but struggle with the
>
> complexities of hive management. Our vision is to empower beekeepers
> with a tool that takes care of the details, so they can enjoy
> beekeeping without the stress.
>
> While our focus is on making beekeeping easier for small-scale
> beekeepers, this project intends to lay the groundwork for future
> expansion, envisioning the evolution of the Bee-Ring into a
> comprehensive solution tailored for large-scale commercial beekeeping.
> We intend to support the diverse needs of all beekeepers, from
> hobbyists to industry professionals, and make the Bee-Ring a valuable
> tool in beekeeping of all scales.

> Alternatives (Wutke, 2023):
>
> ● Gobuzzr is a beehive monitoring system that uses sensors and an app
> to provide instant notifications about temperature changes, weight, or
> humidity levels. They do not monitor bee behaviors, hive activity, or
> honey production\
> ● Beebot tracks temperature, humidity, and bee's buzzing for changes.

> specifically
>
> The Bee-Ring appears to be an upgraded version of what is currently
> available on the market.
>
> Tracking temperature and humidity using wireless hardware seems to be
> a popular technological advancement in the beekeeping industry.
> However, these devices have yet to monitor bee behaviors, hive
> activity, or honey production, which are unique features to the
> Bee-Ring.
>
> **Target Demographics (User Persona)**
>
> There are a few personas we can make based on the specific needs of

> **Integration Requirements**
>
> The product needs to connect with the physical device that is
> monitoring the beehive. The app needs to receive all data requirements
> from the device, and store that data for the user to see through the
> app. We also need to integrate our frontend with the backend design.
>
> **Functional Integration Requirements**
>
> **User Notification Service:**\
> [Integration Point]{.underline}: A Notification Module.
>
> [Functionality]{.underline}**:** Sends real-time notifications to
> users based on hive data and events. [Requirements]{.underline}:
> Immediate and reliable notification delivery with options for user
> preferences.
>
> **Hive Health Analysis Module:**\

>
> ![](vertopal_32383c9222e840e2bfe86325346be26d/media/image1.png){width="6.031944444444444in"
> height="4.988888888888889in"}
>
> The layout could first be based on a website style design that works a
> bit like the canvas interface. This could then be adapted to work as a
> phone app or be expanded into a complete software product. The basic
> design could be built around a dashboard that abstracts the feature as
> cards.
>
> **Dashboard Mockup**:\
> The dashboard is the central hub where users can quickly access
> critical hive data immediately. The design should focus on simplicity,
> clarity, and intuitive data visualization.
>
> [Interactions]{.underline}: Users can interact with widgets displaying
> hive status, environmental/weather conditions, and notifications. They
> can also set preferences for the display of data.
>
> [Mockup Description]{.underline}: A clean and organized dashboard
> featuring real-time data cards for each hive, weather updates, and
> notifications. Users can click on a hive card for detailed
> information.
>
> **Hive Detail Page**:\
> When a user clicks on a hive from the dashboard, they should be
> presented with a detailed view that offers in depth information about
> that hive\'s health and activity.
>
> [Interactions]{.underline}: Users can scroll through historical data
> charts, view sensor data, and access hive-specific settings.
>
> [Mockup Description]{.underline}: The hive detail page includes line
> charts showing temperature and humidity trends, images from the
> hive\'s camera, and buttons for settings adjustments.
>
> **Notification Center**:\
> Notifications are crucial for real-time alerts. The notification
> center should provide a straightforward way to view and manage alerts.
>
> [Interactions]{.underline}: Like an email system, users can see
> notifications categorized by importance, mark them as read, or
> possibly take specific actions in response to alerts.
>
> [Mockup Description]{.underline}: The notification center displays
> notifications with time stamps, and users can mark them as read,
> dismiss them, or click to see more details.
>
> **Settings Panel**:\
> For changing settings or user preferences, the settings panel should
> be user-friendly.
>
> [Interactions]{.underline}: Users can customize notification
> preferences, sensor calibration, and connectivity settings.
>
> [Mockup Description]{.underline}: A clean settings panel with tabs for
> general preferences, notifications, sensor settings, and connectivity
> options.
>
> **Milestones and Timeline**
>
> The planning and researching phase will occur this term until Week 7
> or Week 8. Then we proceed to start working on certain features
> throughout the winter term, and then do testing in the spring. With
> dates, this would be the tentative timeline:
